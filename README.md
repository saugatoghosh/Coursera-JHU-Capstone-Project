# Coursera JHU Data Science Specialization Capstone 

## Project Overview

Around the world, people are spending an increasing amount of time on their mobile devices for email, social networking, banking and a whole range of other activities. But typing on mobile devices can be a serious pain. SwiftKey, our corporate partner in this capstone, builds a smart keyboard that makes it easier for people to type on their mobile devices. One cornerstone of their smart keyboard is predictive text models. When someone types:

I went to the

the keyboard presents three options for what the next word might be. For example, the three words might be gym, store, restaurant. In this capstone you will work on understanding and building predictive text models like those used by SwiftKey.

This course will start with the basics, analyzing a large corpus of text documents to discover the structure in the data and how words are put together. It will cover cleaning and analyzing text data, then building and sampling from a predictive text model. Finally, you will use the knowledge you gained in data products to build a predictive text product you can show off to your family, friends, and potential employers.
